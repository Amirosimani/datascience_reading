## [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00037.pdf)

- Data: saving both raw and intermediate forms; documenting all steps; creating [tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) amenable to analysis; anticipate the future needs.
> Create the dataset you wish you had received
- Code: break down your code to functions; Comment your code, be ruthless in elimating duplicates; Give functions and variables meaningful names; Make dependencies and requirements explicit; Do not comment and uncomment sections of code to control a program’s behavior; Provide a simple example or test data set
> Follow [SDLC](http://treycausey.com/software_dev_skills.html) as much as you can to produce modular code (readable, reusable, and testable)
- Collaboration: Create an overview of your project (readme.md); Create a shared public “to-do” list; embrace code review
- Project: Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project; Follow a logical folder structure - codes in src/ and data in data/; Name all files to reflect their content or function; 
- Version Control: Keep changes small; Share changes frequently;
